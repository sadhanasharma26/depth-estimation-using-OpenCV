# Depth Estimation using OpenCV
In this project, I successfully implemented stereo vision algorithms using Python to achieve real-time depth estimation. The project focused on developing adaptive calibration processes to account for each camera's unique traits and variances, ensuring reliable depth estimates. To achieve this, I employed image rectification techniques to correct lens distortion and align left and right images accurately. Additionally, I maintained pixel correlation between the rectified images to enhance stereo matching.
Using the 2 Logitech cameras, I computed depth and disparity based on stereo picture pairs. Thoroughly assessing the accuracy and precision of depth and disparity measurements, I was able to enhance the accuracy and applicability of the system in robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles. This project showcases my expertise in computer vision and my ability to develop innovative solutions that improve performance and accuracy.
